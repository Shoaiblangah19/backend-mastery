# Day 1 Notes – Classes, __init__, self, instance variables

## What I Learned Today

### 1. Class
A **class** is a blueprint containing attributes and methods of the object together.

### 2. `__init__`
The `__init__` method is like a **constructor** for initializing the object when it is created.

### 3. `self`
`self` is like an **object reference** that is automatically passed to the methods so we can access the attributes of that particular object.

### 4. Instance Variables
**Instance variables** are the properties that each object of the class has individually.
