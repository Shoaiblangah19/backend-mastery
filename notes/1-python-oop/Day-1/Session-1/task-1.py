### ⚡ Micro Task 1 (5 min)

Create 3 empty classes that could exist in a contact management app. Think about what "things" (entities) a contact book system has. Just the class definitions with `pass` — nothing inside yet.

Run your code. It should execute without errors. Then create one object from each class and print them. You'll see something like `<__main__.ClassName object at 0x...>` — that's Python's default way of showing objects.

class Contact:
    pass

class ContactManagement:
    pass

class Search:
    pass

contact = Contact()
contactmanager = ContactManagement()
result = Search()
print(contact)
print(contactmanager)
print(result)
